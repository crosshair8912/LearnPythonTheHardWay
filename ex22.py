print - function - this function instead of others two (sys.stdout() & write()) gives you
more abilities to change output. Like it gives you control of the seperate strings which are
consists of different type of values. You could output as much variables as you want to help you to do this there is 
a special character ',' so you put it after each variable. Also there is a special character '%' if it placed after a string
variable it would input EACH variable that follows after it into previous string on places that marked with same character plus
a some constants like r,d,s (%r,%d,%s). This constants placed into string will show how data would be displayed on the screen.
Also each variable that wants to be transported into final string should have its own place after % character. Simply saying 
there is a queue that shows when first variable was after % character it first would be transported into string place which was
marked by % character inside string + constant. Print function supports concatenation which means sign + gives you the ability
to simply add two string into one final. Character '*' multiplies previous variable to number of the assignment of the next variable.
# - commentary symbol - this character #(sharp) gives you the ability to write a plain text inside your
source file. So does compiler would not read a source file string which is marked by sharp as a code it
would accept this string just as a text information. Simply saying comments would not be translated into
bytecode instead they would be saved as a part of metadata.
variables - number of symbols before the = (equal) sign - those symbols also could consist numbers. Variables
could not be starting from number, they also could not be named as python saved words like: for, in, and others.
Variables is a special object in python language, it becomes by the compilation the type of the argument it assigned to.
You also could give variable  a determined type of standart data types by placing it inside of special function. Name of this
function is a name of special type that you wanna give to this variable, and the argument is your object.
False, True - boolean type constants - this constants simply means descretion of the object they are assighed to. They could work in 
different weys like meaning 1 or 0.
